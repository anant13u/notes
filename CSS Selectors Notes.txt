Selectors in CSS:


Universal Selector:

The universal selector will select elements of any type, hence the name “universal”, and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the color: purple; style applied to it.

* {
  color: purple;
}


ID Selectors:

ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element:

#title {
  background-color: red;
}


Grouping Selector:

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

The above can be instead written like below:

.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}


Chaining Selectors:

.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>

You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:

.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}


Descendant Combinator:

<!-- index.html -->

<div class="ancestor"> <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents"> <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"> <!-- C -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Above can be written as:

<div class="contents"></div> <!-- D -->
/* styles.css */

.ancestor .contents {
  /* some declarations */
}

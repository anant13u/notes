Selectors in CSS:


Universal Selector:
The universal selector will select elements of any type, hence the name “universal”, and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the color: purple; style applied to it.

* {
  color: purple;
}


ID Selectors:
ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element:

#title {
  background-color: red;
}


Grouping Selector:
.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

The above can be instead written like below:
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}


Chaining Selectors:
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

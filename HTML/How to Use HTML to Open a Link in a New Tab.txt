How to Use HTML to Open a Link in a New Tab

The Target Attribute:
This attribute tells the browser how to open the link.

To open a link in a new tab, just set the target attribute to _blank:

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>
Now when someone clicks on the link, it will open up in a new tab, or possibly a new window depending on the 
person's browser settings.


Security concerns with target="_blank":
I strongly recommend that you always add rel="noreferrer noopener" to the anchor element whenever you use 
the target attribute:

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>
This results in the following output:

Check out freeCodeCamp.

The rel attribute sets the relationship between your page and the linked URL. Setting it to noopener noreferrer 
is to prevent a type of phishing known as tabnabbing.

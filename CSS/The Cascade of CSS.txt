The Cascade of CSS

The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML. 
There are different factors that the cascade uses to determine this.

Specificity:

A CSS declaration that is more specific will take precedence over less specific ones. 
Inline styles, have the highest specificity compared to selectors, while each type of selector has its own specificity level 
that contributes to how specific a declaration is. 
Other selectors contribute to specificity, but weâ€™re focusing only on the ones mentioned in this lesson:

1) ID selectors (most specific selector)
2) Class selectors
3) Type selectors

Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it, sort of like 
a tie-breaker. 
An ID selector will always beat any number of class selectors, a class selector will always beat any number of type selectors, 
and a type selector will always beat any number of anything less specific than it. 
When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of that same selector.

<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list subsection"></div>
</div>

/* rule 1 */
.subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}

In the example above, both rules are using only class selectors, but rule 2 is more specific because it is using more class 
selectors, so the color: red; declaration would take precedence.

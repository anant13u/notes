Type Selectors


A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, and the 
syntax is just the name of the element:

<!-- index.html -->

<div>Hello, World!</div>
<div>Hello again!</div>
<p>Hi...</p>
<div>Okay, bye.</div>
/* styles.css */


div {
  color: white;
}
Here, all three <div> elements would be selected, while the <p> element wouldnâ€™t be.

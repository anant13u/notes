Chaining Selectors

https://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors/

Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation. 
Let’s say we had the following HTML:

<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
We have two elements with the subsection class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if 
we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has header as a second class? 
Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:

.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
What .subsection.header does is it selects any element that has both the subsection and header 
classes. Notice how there isn’t any space between the .subsection and .header class selectors. 
This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more 
than one type selector.

This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:

<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:

.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}

.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}
In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different 
types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like div and p would give us the selector 
divp, which wouldn’t work since the selector would try to find a literal <divp> element, which doesn’t exist.

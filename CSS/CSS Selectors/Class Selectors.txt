Class Selectors


Class selectors will select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on 
an HTML element. Here’s how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:

<!-- index.html -->

<div class="alert-text">
  Please agree to our terms of service.
</div>
/* styles.css */

.alert-text {
  color: red;
}
Note the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the 
class attribute. Classes aren’t required to be unique, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.

Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a 
space-separated list, such as class="alert-text severe-alert". Since whitespace is used to separate class 
names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.

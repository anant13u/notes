Grouping Selector


What if we have two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?

.read {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
  /* several unique declarations */
}
Both our .read and .unread selectors share the color: white; and background-color: black; 
declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations. To cut down on the 
repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:

.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}
Both of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second 
example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the color or 
background-color for both classes at once.

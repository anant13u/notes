ID Selectors


ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is 
another attribute you place on an HTML element:

<!-- index.html -->

<div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
/* styles.css */

#title {
  background-color: red;
}
Instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID 
attribute. A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they donâ€™t necessarily need to, 
and when classes will suffice. While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such 
as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you 
should use IDs sparingly (if at all).

The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID. An ID cannot 
be repeated on a single page, and the ID attribute should not contain any whitespace at all.

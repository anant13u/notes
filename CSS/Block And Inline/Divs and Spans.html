    <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>

    <p>We can't talk about block and inline elements without discussing <span class="highlight-text">divs and spans</span>. All the other HTML elements <br>
       we have encountered so far give meaning to their content. For example, paragraph elements tell the browser to <br>
       display the text it contains as a paragraph. Strong elements tell the browser which texts within are important <br>
       and so on. Yet, divs and spans give no particular meaning to their content. They are just generic boxes that <br>
       can contain anything.</p>
        
    <p>Having elements like this available to us is a lot more useful than it may first appear. We will 
       often need elements that <br>serve no other purpose than to be “hook” elements. We can give an id or 
       class to target them for styling with CSS. <br>Another use case we will face regularly is grouping 
       related elements under one parent element to correctly position <br> them on the page. Divs and spans 
       provide us with the ability to do this.</p>

    <p>Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a container element to group other 
       elements.<br>
       Divs allow us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.</p>

    <p>Span is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements for styling <br>
       and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.</p>

Most of the elements that you have learned about so far are block elements. 
In other words, their default style is display: block. By default, block elements will 
appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line.

Inline elements, however, do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever 
elements they are placed beside. A clear example of an inline element is a link, or <a> tag. 
If you stick one of these in the middle of a paragraph of text, it will behave like a part of 
the paragraph. (Like this…) The link’s text will sit alongside other words in that paragraph. 
Additionally, padding and margin behave differently on inline elements. In general, you do not 
want to try to put extra padding or margin on inline elements.

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin. 
Inline-block is a useful tool to know about, but in practice, you’ll probably end up reaching 
for flexbox more often if you’re trying to line up a bunch of boxes. Flexbox will be covered 
in-depth in the next lesson.

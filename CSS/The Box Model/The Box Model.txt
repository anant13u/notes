The Box Model


The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful in CSS is the box 
model. It isn’t complicated, but skipping over it now will cause you much frustration down the line.

Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them 
and can sit alongside one another. You can get a rough idea of how this works by sticking a border 
on every item on the page like this:

* {
  border: 2px solid red;
}

The only real complication here is that there are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes, 
and the space between them, using padding, margin, and border. The assigned articles go into more 
depth on this concept, but to sum it up briefly:



Margin: (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/margin/)
Margin increases the space between a box and any others that sit next to it.
The margin property defines the outermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element, outside of any defined borders.
Margins are set using lengths, percentages, or the keyword auto and can have negative values.

Margin is a shorthand property and accepts up to four values, shown here:

.box {
    margin: <margin-top> || <margin-right> || <margin-bottom> || <margin-left>
}</margin-left></margin-bottom></margin-right></margin-top>



Border: (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border/)
Border adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to.
Syntax:
border: <line-width> || <line-style> || <color>

.box {
  border: 3px solid red;
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
}



Padding:
Padding increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it.
